# Detection of Recolored Images using a Deep Discriminative Model

  Image recoloring is a technique that can transfer image color or theme and result in an imperceptible change in human eyes. Although image recoloring is one of the most important image manipulation techniques, there is no special method designed for detecting this kind of forgery. In this project, we propose a trainable end-to-end system for distinguishing recolored images from natural images. The proposed network takes the original image and two derived inputs based on illumination consistency and inter-channel correlation of the original input into consideration and outputs the probability that it is recolored. Our algorithm adopts a CNN-based deep architecture, which consists of three feature extraction blocks and a feature fusion module. To train the deep neural network, we synthesize a dataset comprised of recolored images and corresponding ground truth using different recoloring methods. Extensive experimental results on the recolored images generated by various methods show that our proposed network is well generalized and much robust.


  In the system we are proposing to implement, we use three feature extractors and a feature fusion module to learn forgery-relevant features. The We adopt the original image as one of the input branches like traditional neural networks. Additionally, we derive DI(Difference Image)s and IM(Illumination Module) as two pieces of evidence of image recolored detection based on the observations that images may not maintain the inter-channel correlation or illuminant consistency after the recoloring process. These two pieces of evidence are employed as two additional input branches together with the original image. Since the learned features are based on a data-driven approach, they are able to describe the intrinsic properties of forgery formation and help distinguishing the authenticity of an image. After extracting forgery-relevant features, we use a feature fusion network to refine these features and output the probability of authenticity. Based on this premise, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on forged images generated by various color transfer methods and the images collected through the Internet.
